Project 2: Latin Squares

In this project, we will read an nxn puzzle from a file and verify it is a valid Latin Square.

A key objective of this project is to practice using pointers. 
To achieve this, I placed limitations on myself, not allowing the usage of array indexing with square brackets to access the array in the latin_square_functions.c file,  e.g., writing “latin_square[1][2]” to access character (1,2) of the latin square. 
Instead, I used address arithmetic and dereferencing to access arrays. 


P.S.: The text files in this folder can be used for testing the code. To compile this project, you must specify the parameters of the program to include whichever text file you want to run it with.
